#### Panic
Sometimes midi notes will continue to make sound - they "hang".
The panic button sends a general midi reset command to the synthsizer that stops all hanging notes.
#### Channel
Here you choose the midi channel that the keyboard will send messages on.
The channels are the same as the channels on the mixer.
You can choose a different instrument for each channel.
